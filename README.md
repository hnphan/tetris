# Multiplayer Tetris
This HTML5/JavaScript version of Tetris allows two players to play against each other. The players do not need to be on the same devices. 

The rule of the game is when a player score, the other player will have new pieces added at the bottom. Each player aims to make the other player die as fast as possible.

The communication between players is faciliated via socket-io and node.js.
